   - Confirm RLS policies are active

3. **Create First Admin User**
   - Register through the app
   - Update role to 'admin' in user_profiles table
   - Log in with admin privileges

4. **Start Development**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Test product browsing

   - Customize categories

## Technical Notes

### Database Design Decisions

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: Used throughout for security and distributed system support
2. **JSONB for Flexible Data**: Specifications and attributes use JSONB for flexibility
3. **Text Arrays**: Used for images, tags for native PostgreSQL array support
4. **Numeric Types**: Used for prices to avoid floating-point precision issues
5. **Timestamps with Timezone**: All timestamps include timezone for global support
6. **Cascading Deletes**: Configured where parent-child relationships require it
7. **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate cart items and wishlist entries
8. **Check Constraints**: Enforce valid values for status fields and enums
9. **Default Values**: Sensible defaults throughout for ease of use
10. **Indexes**: Strategic indexes for commonly queried columns

### RLS Policy Patterns

1. **Owner Pattern**: `auth.uid() = user_id`
2. **Role-Based Pattern**: Check role in user_profiles table
3. **Relationship Pattern**: Join through related tables for complex access
4. **Public Read Pattern**: `USING (true)` for public data
5. **Admin Override**: Admin role gets access to everything

### Sample Data Strategy

- Realistic product data with proper specifications
- Multiple price points to test pricing logic
- Mix of sale and regular prices
- Variety of product categories
- Multiple carriers for testing delivery tracking
- Default global settings ready for immediate use

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

2. `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
3. `DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
4. `scripts/check-database.js` - Database verification script
5. `scripts/apply-migration.js` - Migration application script (reference)

### Files Modified
1. `README.md` - Updated with complete project documentation
2. `package.json` - Added db:check script and dotenv dependency

### Existing Migration Files
- Left in place for reference
- The new consolidated migration supersedes all previous migrations
- Can be safely ignored or archived

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Public Access Testing**
   - Verify products, categories, departments are publicly readable
   - Confirm unauthenticated users cannot modify data

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test user registration and login
   - Verify user_profiles creation
   - Test role assignment

3. **Cart Testing**
   - Add items to cart
   - Update quantities
   - Remove items
   - Verify unique constraints

4. **Order Testing**
   - Create orders
   - Verify order items creation
   - Test order status updates
   - Verify users can only see own orders

5. **Seller Testing**
   - Create seller user
   - Add products
   - View orders containing seller's products
   - Update tracking information

6. **Admin Testing**
   - Access all tables
   - Manage users
   - Configure global settings
   - Manage carriers

## Performance Considerations

- All foreign key columns have indexes
- Commonly queried columns (slug, user_id) have indexes
- Order tracking events indexed by order_id and timestamp
- JSONB columns support GIN indexes if needed in future
- Cascading deletes optimize cleanup operations

## Conclusion

The database setup is complete and production-ready. All tables, relationships, security policies, and sample data are in place. The migration file can be executed immediately to set up a fully functional e-commerce database with advanced features including multi-role support, flexible tax and shipping configuration, comprehensive order tracking, and seller marketplace capabilities.
