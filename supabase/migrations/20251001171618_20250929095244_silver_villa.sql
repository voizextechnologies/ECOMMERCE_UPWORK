  # Update user_profiles RLS policy for admin access

  1. Security Changes
    - Update SELECT policy on `user_profiles` table to allow admins to view all profiles
    - Maintains existing security for regular users to only see their own profile
    - Admins can now access all user profiles for management purposes

  2. Policy Changes
    - Modified "Users can read own profile" policy to include admin access
    - Policy now allows: (user can read own profile) OR (user is admin)
*/
